Pine Script has single-line comments only. Any text from the symbol '''//''' until the end of the line is considered as comment. An example:
<source>
study(“Test”)
// This line is a comment
a = close // This is also a comment
plot(a)
</source>
Script Editor has hotkeys for commenting/uncommenting block of code: <code>Ctrl + /</code> Thanks to this, there is no need for multi-line comments - one can highlight the large code fragment in Script Editor and press <code>Ctrl + /</code>. This will comment out highlighted fragment; if <code>Ctrl + /</code> is pressed again, commentary will be taken away.

Also, comments could not be placed in the middle of a statement wrapped to several lines, read more here: [[Lines Wrapping]].
