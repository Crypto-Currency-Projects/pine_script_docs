A program written in Pine is composed of functions and variables. Functions contain instructions that describe required calculations and variables that save the values used in the process of those calculations. The source code line should not start with spaces (there is an exception, see “[[Declaring Functions#Multi-line Functions|syntax of a multiline function]]”).

A script should contain a '''study''' function which specifies the script name and some other script properties. Script body contains functions and variables necessary to calculate the result which will be rendered as a chart with a '''plot''' function call.

As a first example, we’ll examine the implementation of the [[MACD]] indicator:
<source>
study("MACD")
fast = 12, slow = 26
fastMA = ema(close, fast)
slowMA = ema(close, slow)
macd = fastMA - slowMA
signal = sma(macd, 9)
plot(macd, color=blue)
plot(signal, color=orange)
</source>

; study("MACD")
: Sets the name of the indicator — “MACD”
; fast = 12, slow = 26
: Defines two integer variables, ‘fast’ and ‘slow’.
; fastMA = ema(close, fast)
: Defines the variable fastMA, containing the result of the calculation EMA (Exponential Moving Average) with the length equal to ‘fast’ (12) on ’close’ series (closing prices of bars).
; slowMA = ema(close, slow)
: Defines the variable slowMA, containing the result of the calculation EMA with the length equal to ‘slow’ (26) from ‘close’.
; macd = fastMA - slowMA
: Defines the variable ‘macd’, which is being calculated as a difference between two EMA with different length inputs.
; signal = sma(macd, 9)
: Defines the variable ‘signal’, calculated as a smooth value of the variable ‘macd’ by the algorithm SMA (Simple Moving Average) with length equal to 9
; plot(macd, color=blue)
: Call function ‘plot’, which would draw a chart based on the values saved in the variable ‘macd’ (the color of the line is blue).
; plot(signal, color=orange)
: Call function ‘plot’, which would draw a chart for the variable ‘signal’ with an orange color.

After adding the indicator “MACD” to the chart we would see the following:

Pine contains a variety of built-in functions for the most popular algorithms ([[Moving Average#Simple Moving Average (SMA)|sma]], [[Moving Average#Exponential Moving Average (EMA)|ema]], [[Moving Average#Weighted Moving Average (WMA)|wma]], etc.) as well as making it possible to create your custom functions. You can find a description of all available built-in functions [https://www.tradingview.com/study-script-reference/ here].
In the following sections the document will describe in full all the Pine Script capabilities.
