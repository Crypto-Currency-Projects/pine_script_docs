A script in Pine syntactically consists of a series of statements. Each statement usually is placed on a separate line. It’s possible to place a few statements on one line, dividing them with a comma <code>,</code>. The first statement on the line must be placed at the beginning, keeping in mind that spaces before the statement are not allowed (this has a direct relation to the syntax of multiple line functions). Statements are one of three kinds:
* [[Expressions, Declarations and Statements#Variable Declarations|variable definitions]]
* [[Declaring Functions|function definitions]]
* [[Functions vs Annotation Functions|annotation function calls]]
Long statements that don’t fit within in the width of the screen can be split to a few lines, further information about this can be found [[Lines Wrapping|here]].
