Identifiers are simply names for user-defined variables and functions. Identifiers can be composed from lower and upper-case letters (from the English alphabet), underscore ‘_’  and numbers, however an identifier cannot begin with a number. Line and upper-case symbols differ (Pine is case-sensitive). Here are some examples of valid identifiers:
<source>
myVar
_myVar
my123Var
MAX_LEN
max_len
</source>
