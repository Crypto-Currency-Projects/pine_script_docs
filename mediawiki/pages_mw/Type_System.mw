The basic type of data in Pine is a list of values, named '''series'''. Examples of built-in series variables are: '''open''', '''high''', '''low''', '''close''', '''volume'''. The size of these vectors are equal to the quantity of available bars based on the current ticker and timeframe (resolution). The series may contain numbers or a special value '''NaN''' (meaning ‘absence of value’). (Further information about '''NaN''' values can be found  [[Operators#History Referencing Operator .28Square Brackets .5B.5D.29|here]]). Any expression that contains a series variable will be treated as a series itself.  For example:
<source>
a = open + close // addition of two series
b = high / 2         // division of a series variable
// to the integer literal constant (b will be a
// series)
c = close[1]         // Referring to the previous ‘close’ value
</source>

Footnote: The operator '''[]''' also returns a value of a series type.

Pine has two types to represent numbers: '''integer''' and '''float'''. The result of an arithmetical expression containing only numbers will be a number itself.

There is also '''string''' type which is used for the indicators names, inputs, line graphs, names of tickers, resolutions, trade sessions, etc.

Also Pine has '''bool''' type. There are two built-in constants: '''true''' and '''false'''. 

And the last basic type is '''color'''. Apart from configuring a color value directly with a literal (in hexadecimal format), in the language there are more convenient, built-in variables of the type '''color'''. For basic colors there are: '''black''', '''silver''', '''gray''', '''white''', '''maroon''', '''red''', '''purple''', '''fuchsia''', '''green''', '''lime''', '''olive''', '''yellow''', '''navy''', '''blue''', '''teal''', '''aqua''', '''orange'''. It is possible to change transparency of the color using build-in function [https://www.tradingview.com/study-script-reference/#fun_color color].

A few function annotations (in particular '''plot''' and '''hline''') return values which represent objects created on the chart. The function '''plot''' returns an object of the type '''plot''', represented as a line or diagram on the chart. The function '''hline''' returns an object of the type '''hline''', represented as a horizontal line. These objects can be passed to the function '''fill''' to fill area between them.

== Cast Rules ==

In the following picture arrow means ability to cast one type to another. For example '''NotAvailable''' type, an <code>na</code> variable, can be cast to any '''color''', '''integer''', '''float''' or '''series''' types. But '''color''' can only be casted to '''color series''' type.
