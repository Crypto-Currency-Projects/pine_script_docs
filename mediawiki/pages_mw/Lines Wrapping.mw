Any statement that is too long in Pine Script can be placed on a few lines. Syntactically, '''a statement must begin at the beginning of the line. If it wraps to the next line then the continuation of the statement must begin with one or several (different from multiple of 4) spaces'''. For example, the expression:

<source>a = open + high + low + close</source>

may be wrapped as

<source>a = open +
      high +
          low +
             close</source>

The long <code>plot</code> call line may be wrapped as

<source>plot(correlation(src, ovr, length),
   color=purple,
   style=area,
   transp=40)</source>

Statements inside user functions also can be wrapped to several lines. However, since syntactically a local statement must begin with an indentation (4 spaces or 1 tab) then, when splitting it onto the following line, the continuation of the statement must start with more than one indentation (and not equal to multiple of 4 spaces). For example:

<source>updown(s) =>  
    isEqual = s == s[1]
    isGrowing = s > s[1]    
    ud = isEqual ?
           0 :
           isGrowing ?
               (nz(ud[1]) <= 0 ?
                     1 :
                   nz(ud[1])+1) :
               (nz(ud[1]) >= 0 ?
                   -1 :
                   nz(ud[1])-1)
</source>

Note, that this rule also apply to comments. Don't use comments combined with lines wrapping. Following code would NOT compile:
<source>
//@version=2
study("My Script")
c = open > close ? red :
  high > high[1] ? lime : // a comment
  low < low[1] ? blue : black
bgcolor(c)
</source>
Compiler fails with error: <code>Add to Chart operation failed, reason: line 3: no viable alternative at input '|E|'</code>.
To make this pine work, simply remove the '// a comment' comment. This limitation is inconvenient... We hope it could be removed in future Pine releases.
