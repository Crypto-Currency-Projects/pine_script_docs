=Description=
On TradingView it's possible to use pre-built indicators and write custom ones using [https://www.tradingview.com/study-script-reference/ Pine Script]. Users who write their own scripts can publish them to the [https://www.tradingview.com/script/ Public Library]. You can search the library for needed scripts before writing one. You can also ask users who publish scripts for help by sending them a private message (PM) on TradingView.

'''Public Library''' is the storage of all user-published scripts.
All published scripts can be viewed on [https://www.tradingview.com/script/ this page], or in the Indicators window -> Public Library tab:

=Copying a Script from Public to Personal Library=
To copy a script choose one of two methods: 
<br>1. Click the star next to the needed script in the Indicators window:
<br>[[File:Add_to_Personal_Library.png]]
<br><br>2. Or open the needed script on [https://www.tradingview.com/script/ this page] and click the "Add to Favorite Scripts" button: 
<br>[[File:Add_to_Personal_Library_2.png]]

<br>The script will be added to your Favorites section in the Indicators window, where you can easily find it when needed.

<br>Scripts in the Indicators window are sorted by popularity: the more users have favorited the script, the higher it will be displayed in the Indicators window.

=Editing a Script from the Public Library=
To edit a script:
<br>1. Open the script (the script will be unavailable for editing and will be colored lighter than normal):
<br>[[File:Open_the_script.png]]
<br><br>2. Click "Save as", enter the desired name and save a copy to your personal library:
<br>[[File:Save_as.png]]

<br>A saved copy of the script will appear in the list of your scripts in the Indicators window, "My Scripts" tab:
<br>[[File:My_Scripts.png]]
<br><br>Now you can open and edit the script.

If the same script is published more than once, a notification on older versions will appear that a new version is available. 

=Searching for a Script=
To search for a script:

In the Indicators dialog use the Search field:
<br>[[File:Search_field.png]]
<br><br>This will search your Personal and Public Library at the same time:
