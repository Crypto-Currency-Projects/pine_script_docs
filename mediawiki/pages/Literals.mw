Fixed values assigned with immediate values (e.g., 10, 2, "value"), which may not be altered by the script, are called literals. Literals can only be a type of integer, float, bool and string.

Footnote: in Pine there are no literals which represent values of a series type. Instead, there are built-in variables of a series type (such as '''open''', '''high''', '''low''', '''close''', '''volume''', '''hl2''', '''hlc3''', '''ohlc4'''). These variables are not literals.

== Integer Literals ==
Integral-valued literals can be presented only in the decimal system. Examples:
<pine>
1
750
94572
100
</pine>

== Floating-point Literals ==
Real literals in comparison with integral-valued literals contain a delimiter (the symbol <code>.</code>) and/or the symbol '''e''' (which means “multiply by 10 to the power of X”, where X is the number after the symbol '''e''') or both. Examples:
<pine>
3.14159    // 3.14159
6.02e23    // 6.02 * 10^23
1.6e-19    // 1.6 * 10^-19
3.0        // 3.0
</pine>
The first number is the rounded number Pi (π), the second number is very large, while the third is very small. The fourth number is simply the number ‘3’ as a floating point number.

Footnote: it’s possible to use uppercase “E” instead of lowercase “e”.

== Boolean Literals ==
There are only two literals for representing logical values:
<pine>
true          // true value
false         // false value
</pine>

== String Literals ==

String literals may be enclosed by single or double quotation marks, for example:
<pine>
"This is a double quoted string literal"
'This is a single quoted string literal'
</pine>

Single or double quotation marks are completely the same — you may use what you prefer.
The line that was written with double quotation marks may contain a single quotation mark, just as a line that is written with single quotation marks may contain double quotation marks:
<pine>
"It's an example"
'The "Star" indicator'
</pine>

If a user needs to put either double quotation marks in a line that is enclosed by double quotation marks (or put single quotation marks in a line that is enclosed by single quotation marks,) then they must be preceded with backslash. Examples:
<pine>
'It\'s an example'
"The \"Star\" indicator"
</pine>

== Color Literals ==
Color literals have the following format: '''#''' followed by 6 or 8 hexadecimal digits matching RGB or RGBA value. The first two digits determine the value for the Red color component, the second two — for green, and the third pair — the value for the Blue component. Fourth pair of digits is optional. When set, it specifies the ‘alpha’ (opacity) value. Examples:
<pine>
#000000                // black color
#FF0000                // red color
#00FF00                // green color
#0000FF                // blue color
#FFFFFF                // white color
#808080                // gray color
#3ff7a0                // some custom color
#FF000080                // semi-transparent red color
#00FF00FF                // same as #00FF00
#00FF0000                // completely transparent color
</pine>

It is possible to change transparency of the color using build-in function [https://www.tradingview.com/study-script-reference/#fun_color color].

Footnote: When using hexadecimal figures it’s possible to use them in either upper or lowercase.
