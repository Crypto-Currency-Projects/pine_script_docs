Description
-----------

On TradingView it's possible to use pre-built indicators and write
custom ones using `Pine
Script <https://www.tradingview.com/study-script-reference/>`__. Users
who write their own scripts can publish them to the `Public
Library <https://www.tradingview.com/script/>`__. You can search the
library for needed scripts before writing one. You can also ask users
who publish scripts for help by sending them a private message (PM) on
TradingView.

| **Public Library** is the storage of all user-published scripts. All
  published scripts can be viewed on `this
  page <https://www.tradingview.com/script/>`__, or in the Indicators
  window -> Public Library tab:
| |Public_Library_tab|

Copying a Script from Public to Personal Library
------------------------------------------------

| To copy a script choose one of two methods:
| 1. Click the star next to the needed script in the Indicators window:
| |Add_to_Personal_Library|
| 2. Or open the needed script on `this
  page <https://www.tradingview.com/script/>`__ and click the “Add to
  Favorite Scripts” button:
| |Add_to_Personal_Library_2|

| 
| The script will be added to your Favorites section in the Indicators
  window, where you can easily find it when needed.
| |Favorites_section|

| 
| Scripts in the Indicators window are sorted by popularity: the more
  users have favorited the script, the higher it will be displayed in
  the Indicators window.
| |Sorted_by_popularity|

Editing a Script from the Public Library
----------------------------------------

| To edit a script:
| 1. Open the script (the script will be unavailable for editing and
  will be colored lighter than normal):
| |Open_the_script|
| 2. Click “Save as”, enter the desired name and save a copy to your
  personal library:
| |Save_as|

| 
| A saved copy of the script will appear in the list of your scripts in
  the Indicators window, “My Scripts” tab:
| |My_Scripts|
| Now you can open and edit the script.

If the same script is published more than once, a notification on older
versions will appear that a new version is available.

Searching for a Script
----------------------

To search for a script:

| In the Indicators dialog use the Search field:
| |Search_field|
| This will search your Personal and Public Library at the same time:
| |Search|
