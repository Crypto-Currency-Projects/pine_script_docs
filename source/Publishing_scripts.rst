Publishing scripts
==================

.. contents:: :local:

Users who write scripts and wish to share them with others can publish them. If you write scripts for your own use only, you can save them in the Pine Editor and use them from there. You do not need to publish them.

Public vs private scripts
-------------------------

You can share scripts with other users in two ways: **publicly** or **privately**. Either way you will be able to choose if you publish your script in *open source*, *protected* or *invite-only* mode. When you publish a script:

- Your script must have a name, a description explaining what your script does and how to use it, and a chart.
- Once published, you will not be able to modify the script's original description.
- The chart published with you script is the one in use when you publish, including any other scripts or drawings on it.
- The script's code can later be updated. Each update can include *release notes* which will appear, dated, under your original description.
- Your published scripts appear under the *Scripts* tab of your user profile.
- A *script widget* and a *script page* are created for your script. The script widget is your script's placeholder showing in lists of scripts. It contains your script's title, chart and the first few lines of your description. When users click on your script widget, the script's page opens. It contains all the information relating to your script. 

**Public scripts**:

- Are published in TradingView's :doc:`Public_Library` where they become visible to the millions of users in the international TradingView community.
- Cannot be deleted.
- Must comply with our `script publishing House Rules <https://www.tradingview.com/house-rules/#scripts>`__ and are subject to moderation.

**Private scripts**:

- Are only published on your user profile's *Scripts* tab. If you want to share them with other users, use the script's url.
- Can be identified with the "X" icon in the top right of their widget.
- Can be deleted.
- Are not moderated.
- Cannot be linked to or mentioned from public TradingView content (ideas, script descriptions, comments, chats, etc.).

How to publish a script
-----------------------



To publish an *open source* Pine script:

#. Open the Pine Script Editor: |Publishing_scripts_Editor_button|
#. Open/write the script.
#. Apply the script to the current chart and arrange the chart the way you want it to appear when it is published with your script.
#. Click the *Publish Script* button: |Publish_script_button|
#. Select the *Publish New Script* button: |Publish_script_new|
#. Enter the script's title, tags (optional) and description.
#. Click the *Publish Script* button.

The published script will be displayed in the `Public Library <https://www.tradingview.com/script/>`__,
which is available to all TradingView users. Any registered TradingView user will be able to make a copy of
your script.

#Choosing a licence

Choosing to use an open source license is entirely up to you. You are under no
obligation to do so. If you publish scripts with open source code you
may choose the license of your choice. You can include the license in
the comments section of your script (preferably in the beginning). Our
position on the matter is similar to that of
`GitHub <https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/>`__.


Protected
^^^^^^^^^

It is possible to publish scripts in *protected source* mode. This is a
high-demand feature that lets you share knowledge while protecting your
intellectual property. These scripts are available
in the :doc:`Public_Library` and any user can use them, but only the
author can see the source code. Users can view, comment and favorite
the script. It will also be available in the Public Library section of the
Indicators dialog box, and any user will be able to add this script to a chart. Only the
author, however, can view the source code of protected scripts. This is a great
option for those who want to share a script while protecting its code.

To publish a script using protected mode, simply choose *Protected* prior to
publishing from the script publication window:

|Protected_script_new|

Invite-only
^^^^^^^^^^^

Authors can choose to manage who can access their scripts. This is great for
commercial vendors, or authors who want to protect their IP or share
with only a few select people. Authors who whish to sell access to their scripts
must arrange for off-site payment and then use TradingView's *Manage Access* feature to
provide access to customers.

To publish a script using the managed access mode, simply choose the *Invite Only* option prior to publishing
from the script's publication window.
Only users you specifically add will then be able to use your script.

|Invite_only_script_new|

On the published script's page, authors will see a *Manage Access* button, where they can add/remove
users and manage access rights.

|Manage_access_button|

Invite-only indicators are visible in the :doc:`Public_Library`,
but nobody can add them to a chart without
explicit permission from the author, and only the author can see the script's
source code. Users may view, comment and favorite the script.
TradingView does not take a percentage of revenue from script sales.

All your scripts published in managed access mode are shown in a
separate section of the Indicators window:

|Invite_only_tab|
