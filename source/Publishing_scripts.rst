Publishing scripts
==================

.. contents:: :local:

Users who write scripts and wish to share them with others can publish them. If you write scripts for your own use only, you can save them in the Pine Editor; you do not need to publish them.



Public vs private scripts
-------------------------

You can share scripts with other users in two ways: **publicly** or **privately**. Either way you will be able to publish your script in *open source*, *protected* or *invite-only* mode.

When you publish a script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Your script must have a name, a description explaining what your script does and how to use it, and a chart.
- The chart published with you script is the one in use when you publish, including any other scripts or drawings on it.
- Once published, you will not be able to modify the script's original description.
- The script's code can later be updated. Each update can include *release notes* which will appear, dated, under your original description.
- Scripts can be liked, shared, commented on or reported by other users.
- Your published scripts appear under the *Scripts* tab of your user profile.
- A *script widget* and a *script page* are created for your script. The script widget is your script's placeholder showing in lists of scripts. It contains your script's title, chart and the first few lines of your description. When users click on your script widget, the script's page opens. It contains all the information relating to your script. 

Public scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Are published in TradingView's :doc:`Public_Library` where they become visible to the millions of users in the international TradingView community.
- Cannot be deleted.
- Must comply with our `script publishing House Rules <https://www.tradingview.com/house-rules/#scripts>`__ and are subject to moderation.
- Are accessible through the search functions for scripts.

Private scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Are only published on your user profile's *Scripts* tab. If you want to share them with other users, use the script's url.
- Can be identified with the "X" icon in the top right of their widget, which is used to delete a private script.
- Are not moderated.
- Cannot be linked to or mentioned from public TradingView content (ideas, script descriptions, comments, chats, etc.).
- Are not accessible through the search functions for scripts.



Publishing modes
----------------

Open source
^^^^^^^^^^^

The Pine code of scripts published in open-source mode is available to all users. Open-source scripts on TradingView use the Mozilla license by default, but you may choose any license you want. You can find information on licensing at `GitHub <https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/>`__.

Protected
^^^^^^^^^

The code of protected scripts is hidden from view and no one but its author can access it. While the script's code is not accessible, protected scripts can be used freely by any user.

Invite-only
^^^^^^^^^^^

The invite-only publishing mode protects both the script's code and its accecss. The script's publisher must explicitly grant access to each user of an invite-only script. This mode is useful to authors who want to control who can access their script. It can be used by script vendors providing paid access to their scripts. This feature is only available to Premium accounts. Special House Rules apply to invite-only publications, as well as to script vendors.

TradingView does not benefit from script sales. Transactions concerning invite-only scripts are strictly between users and vendors, and do not involve TradingView.

Invite-only scripts are the only type of public scripts for which paid access is allowed on TradingView.

On their invite-only script's page, authors will see a *Manage Access* button. The *Manage Access* window allows authors to control who has access to their script.

How to publish a script
-----------------------

To publish an *open source* Pine script:

#. Prepare your description offline.
#. Prepare your chart. Load your script on the chart and remove other scripts or drawings that won't help users understand your script. Your script's plots should be easy to identify on the chart that will be published with it.
#. Load your code in the Pine Editor if it isn't already.
#. Open the Pine Script Editor: |Publishing_scripts-01-Editor_button|
#. Click the *Publish Script* button: |Publishing_scripts-02-Publish_button|
#. Select the *Publish New Script* button: |Publish_script_new|
#. Enter the script's title, tags (optional) and description.
#. Click the *Publish Script* button.



To publish a script using protected mode, simply choose *Protected* prior to
publishing from the script publication window:

|Protected_script_new|

or authors who want to protect their IP or share
with only a few select people. Authors who whish to sell access to their scripts
must arrange for off-site payment and then use TradingView's *Manage Access* feature to
provide access to customers.

To publish a script using the managed access mode, simply choose the *Invite Only* option prior to publishing
from the script's publication window.
Only users you specifically add will then be able to use your script.

|Invite_only_script_new|


Invite-only indicators are visible in the :doc:`Public_Library`,
but nobody can add them to a chart without
explicit permission from the author, and only the author can see the script's
source code. Users may view, comment and favorite the script.
TradingView does not take a percentage of revenue from script sales.

All your scripts published in managed access mode are shown in a
separate section of the Indicators window:

|Invite_only_tab|
