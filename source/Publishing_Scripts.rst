Publishing Scripts
==================

.. contents:: :local:
    :depth: 2

On TradingView it's possible to write custom indicators using `Pine
Script <Pine_Script_Tutorial>`__. Users who write their own scripts can
publish them to the `Public Library <Public_Library>`__ to share their
scripts with other users. Each published script gets a page with its
description, screenshot and source code, so users can see what the
script is about before applying it. If you want to protect your
indicator, you can use Protected and Invite-Only scripts, which hides
the source code from other users.

| To publish a script:
| 1. Open Pine Script Editor:
| |Pine_editor|
| 2. Open/write the script;
| 3. Apply the script to the current chart;
| 4. Click the “Publish Script” button:
| |Publish_script_button|
| |Publish_script_new|
| 5. Enter Script Title, Tags (optional), Description;
| 6. Click the “Publish Script” button.

The published script will be displayed in `Public
Library <Public_Library>`__, which is available to all TradingView
users. Every registered TradingView user will be able to make a copy of
your script.

Protected source code for Pine indicators
-----------------------------------------

Now you can publish indicators with protected source code. This is a
high-demand feature that lets you share knowledge and protect
intellectual property at the same time. These indicators are available
in the public Script Library, and any user can use it, but only the
author can see the source code. Each user can view, comment and favorite
the script’s page with its description, screenshot and author’s
comments. It’s will available in the Public Library section in the
Indicators dialog, and any user can add this script to a chart. Only the
author can open the source code of Protected scripts. This is a great
option for those who want to share the script, but protect its
calculation methods.

To make the indicator Protected simply check “Protected Script” in the
script publication window.

Source code on charts is hidden from other users, so that only you will
see it until you decide to publish an open source version. Publish
ideas, send links to charts in chat - your intellectual property remains
protected and no one will have access to your source code without your
decision.

Pine Indicators with Managed Access
-----------------------------------

Authors can manage who can access their indicators. This is great for
commercial vendors, or authors who want to protect their IP, or share
with only a few select people - the reasons could be many. If someone
wishes to sell indicators, the author may charge off-site for them, and
then provide access to the paying customers.

| Simply choose the “Invite-only script” option when publishing, and
  only users who you specifically add will be able to use it.
  |Invite_only_script_new| On the published script’s page
  authors will see a Manage Access button, where you can add/remove
  users, and manage access rights.
| |Manage_access_button|

| The invite-only indicators are visible in the `Public
  Library <Public_Library>`__, but nobody can add it to a chart without
  explicit permission from the author, and only the author can see the
  source code. Each user can view, comment and favorite the script’s
  page with its description, screenshot and author’s comments, and it’s
  available in the Public Library section in the Indicators dialog. Only
  users with explicit permission from the author can add the script to a
  chart. Nobody except the author can view the source code of these
  scripts. This is a great option for commercial script vendors, or
  authors who want to share the script only with a few select users. If
  the author wishes to charge for access to these scripts, they may do
  so off-site and then provide access to their customers. TradingView
  does not require a percentage of the sales from such transactions. All
  of your published scripts with limited access are shown in a new
  section.
