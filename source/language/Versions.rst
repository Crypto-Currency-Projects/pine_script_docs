Versions
--------

Currently there are four versions of Pine Script Language. A special
directive must be used in the first line of a code to switch between
versions ``//@version=N`` where ``N`` is number. Note, that Pine Script
Language versions are incompatible with each other. 

Notable changes are documented in :doc:`/Release_notes`.
