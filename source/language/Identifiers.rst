Identifiers
===========

Identifiers are names used for user-defined variables and functions.
They can be composed of:

-  upper and lower case letters (from the English alphabet),
-  underscore (``_``),
-  numbers.

An identifier cannot begin with a number. Identifiers are case-sensitive. 
Here are some examples of valid identifiers::

    myVar
    _myVar
    my123Var
    MAX_LEN
    max_len
