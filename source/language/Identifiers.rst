Identifiers
===========

Identifiers are simply names for user-defined variables and functions.
Identifiers can be composed of lower and upper-case letters (from the
English alphabet), underscore ``_`` and numbers. An identifier
cannot begin with a number. Identifiers are case-sensitive. 
Here are some examples of valid identifiers::

    myVar
    _myVar
    my123Var
    MAX_LEN
    max_len
