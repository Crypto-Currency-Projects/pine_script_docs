Structure of the script
=======================

A script in Pine syntactically consists of a series of statements. Each
statement usually is placed on a separate line. It's possible to place a
few statements on one line, dividing them with a comma ``,``. The first
statement on the line must be placed at the beginning, keeping in mind
that spaces before the statement are not allowed (this has a direct
relation to the syntax of multiple line functions). Statements are one
of three kinds:

-  :ref:`variable declarations <variable_declaration>`
-  :doc:`function declarations <Declaring_functions>`
-  :doc:`functions and annotations calls <Functions_and_annotations>`

Long statements that don't fit within in the width of the screen can be
split to a few lines, further information about this can be found
:doc:`here <Lines_wrapping>`.
